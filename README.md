#🎬 Netfilx_project_IBM

📘 Overview

This project analyzes the Netflix Movies and TV Shows dataset to uncover insights about the platform’s content — including genre trends, release patterns, and content distribution across countries.
It was created as part of my academic Data Analytics project to demonstrate skills in Python, data cleaning, and visualization.

🧠 Objective

The main goal of this project is to understand:

How Netflix’s content has evolved over the years.

Which countries and genres dominate the platform.

The proportion of Movies vs. TV Shows.

Patterns in ratings and release years.

🛠️ Tools & Technologies Used

Python 🐍

Pandas → for data cleaning and manipulation

Matplotlib & Seaborn → for data visualization

Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab → for coding and analysis

PowerPoint (MS PPT) → for final presentation

📊 Key Visualizations

Movies vs. TV Shows – Count comparison using a bar chart.

Top 10 Countries – Countries with the most Netflix titles.

Most Common Ratings – Distribution of content ratings (like TV-MA, PG, R, etc.).

Top 10 Genres – Popular content types by category.

Trend Over Time – Growth of Netflix content by release year.

🧩 Process Overview
1. Data Loading

Loaded the Netflix dataset using Pandas and checked its structure using df.info() and df.head().

2. Data Cleaning

Filled missing values in country, rating, and date_added.

Removed duplicate entries.

Converted date_added column to datetime format.

3. Data Analysis

Performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) to find trends and patterns.

4. Visualization

Created simple, clear, and easy-to-understand visualizations to explain insights.

5. Report Preparation

Summarized results and exported key findings to a PowerPoint Presentation for academic submission.

📈 Key Insights

Movies dominate Netflix’s library compared to TV Shows.

The United States produces the highest number of Netflix titles.

The most frequent rating is TV-MA, indicating mature audience content.

Dramas and Comedies are the most popular genres.

A major increase in content was observed after 2015, showing Netflix’s expansion era.
